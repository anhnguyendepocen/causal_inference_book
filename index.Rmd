# About {-}

This notebook contains R code for part 2 of [*Causal Inference*](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) by Miguel Hern√°n and Jamie Robins [@hernan_causal_2019]. While R, SAS, Stata, and Python code are available on the website for *Causal Inference*, we focus on doing causal inference using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem of R packages, particularly ggplot2, dplyr, and broom.
